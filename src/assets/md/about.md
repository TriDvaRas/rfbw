Civilizator's main feature is randomizing Civilization picks (also known as CivRandomizer). 
Currently supported games are: Civ5, Civ5+LEK, Civ6. 
Randomizer gives each player a set of civs to pick from.
If you enable bans players can also ban civs, removing them from random pool
DLCs can also be disabled if someone doesn't have some or you just want to play Vanilla game
After everyone got their civs they can vote to reroll. If 70%+ of players has voted all player will get a new set to pick from.
